    <h1><a href="https://github.com/accord-net/framework/">Fork this project on GitHub!</a></h1>
    <p>
        Currently, the preferred way of contributing code to the project is through the
        <a href="https://github.com/accord-net/framework/">project's GitHub page</a>. You
        can create a fork of the project under your own repositories and start working from
        there. When you believe you have finished and would like to send your contributions
        to the project, please <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">
            create a pull request
        </a> so the project maintainers can review and hopefully
        accept incorporating your code into the main branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite being the preferred venue for sharing contributions, the project will always
        be open to suggestions and will never recriminate if you chose to share your code
        another way - such as sending them over by email, like most of the contributions
        we received over the years. But if you can, please try to share it through GitHub
        with us! Unfortunately, email is far too easy to miss, specially in a crowded inbox.
    </p>
